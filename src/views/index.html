    <h2><span class="firstletter">A</span>bout the Reviewer</h2>

    <div id="mid-home-panel">
      <p>The author of Passable Beer Reviews hates to admit it now, but after his first sip of beer he had two thoughts: "Hey, this Natural Ice is a good beer," and "I think I like beer." He was, as usual, half right. The author, now a 38-year-old husband and father, does like beer. He started Passable Beer Reviews to help fellow beer-likers separate the merely inoffensive adjunct lagers from those that should be shunned by polite society, like Natty Ice. To learn more about his personal beer preferences, visit the <a href="/favoritebeers.html">favorite</a> beers page dedicated to the topic.</p>
